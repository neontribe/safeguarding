# Appropriate Workplace Behaviour

## Policy

### Aim

Neontribe is committed to providing a workplace that values teamwork, respect and recognition and integrity.  We  place  great emphasis on our values and ask all employees to adhere to them as they are the foundation of our culture and reputation.

This policy articulates and supports the integration of these values in day to day behaviour and decision making.  It will be updated from time to time and additional content may be added as particular needs arise.

### Scope

All staff of Neontribe must be aware of and comply with this policy.

### Policy

If, at any time, you are unclear about the application of these guidelines, or require further information, you should speak with your supervisor or a director.

Non-compliance with this policy may result in disciplinary action, up to and including summary dismissal in the most serious of cases.  Employees who breach the law may also be personally liable for their action.

## Equal employment opportunity

Neontribe is committed to providing a workplace for all employees that is inclusive of difference.  Neontribe values the diversity of our  workforce  and  aims  to  provide  a  work  environment  that  recognises,  respects,  and  enables  everyone  to  work  effectively towards the achievement of our goals.

Recognising  diversity  acknowledges  that  different  people  have  different  needs,  at  different  times  in  their  lives;  and  that  treating  everybody  in  the  same  way  at  all  times,  may  not  account  for  these  differences.   Managing  diversity  is  the process of recognising, utilising and benefiting from the variety of backgrounds amongst our people.

Neontribe  practices  Equal  Employment  Opportunity.   Equal  employment  opportunity  (EEO)  ensures  that  all  employment  decisions  are  made  on  the  basis  of  merit,  taking  into  account  all  relevant  skills  and  experience,  without  bias  or prejudice.  We  strive  to  achieve  diversity  in  applicant  groups,  short–listed  candidates  and  overall  appointments  for  recruitment and promotion purposes.

Special measures intended to achieve equality, otherwise known as positive discrimination, are permitted in certain circumstances. Where Neontribe intends to implement special measures for the purpose of achieving  substantive  equality  between  diverse  groups,  Neontribe  will  advise  the  people  who  may  be  affected  by  this  decision and the reason for adopting the special measure.

## Anti-discrimination

It  is  our  aim  to  have  a  work  environment  where  individual  difference  and  diversity  is  encouraged  and  people  can  work and relate in an environment free from discrimination.

_What is discrimination?_

Discrimination occurs when an employee is treated less favourably in their employment based on irrelevant factors or characteristics.

Employment  decisions  are  unlawful  if  they  are  made  on  the  basis  of  a  person's  physical  appearance,  race,  nationality or ethnic origin, colour, social origin, ethical belief, political conviction, trade union activity, religious belief,employment  status,  criminal  record,  gender,  sexuality  or  sexual  orientation,  transgender,  marital  status  including  occupation of spouse or partner, parental status and family responsibilities, pregnancy or potential pregnancy, age, disability (including HIV or AIDS), physical impairment or carer's responsibilities.

Discrimination  can  be  both  direct  and  indirect.   Direct  discrimination  occurs  when  a  person  is  treated  differently  because of a certain factor or characteristic. Indirect discrimination can occur when a requirement, which is the same for  everyone,  has  an  unfair  effect  on  some  people  because  of  a  specific  attribute  they  possess  (eg  sex,  race,  disability).

## Harassment/sexual harassment

Neontribe does not tolerate any behaviour that creates a hostile or distressing environment, undermines morale, or reflects adversely on the integrity of our organisation.

All forms of harassment and bullying are unacceptable and depending on the severity can lead to disciplinary action or dismissal.

_What is harassment?_

 - Harassment is any uninvited, unwelcome, behaviour that offends, humiliates or intimidates another person, whether or not that effect is intended.
 - It may be specifically aimed at people with particular or different characteristics or be general behaviour that isn’t directed at any particular person.
 - Behaviour constituting harassment is often a matter of personal perception and interpretation, and tolerance for what is considered 'acceptable behaviour' may vary widely among individuals.
 - Harassment may occur as a single act, or as a series of incidents, persistent innuendoes or threats. It can happen in the workplace or at a work–related function
 - Harassment  can  take  many  forms,  it  may  be  silent  or  loud,  subtle  or  openly  hostile,  it  can  be  private  or  public.
  - Harassment  of  another  person  on  the  basis  of  his  or  her  physical  appearance,  race,  nationality  or  ethnic  origin,   colour,   social   origin,   ethical   belief,   political   conviction,   trade   union   activity,   religious   belief,   employment  status,  irrelevant  criminal  record,  gender,  sexuality  or  sexual  orientation,  transgender,  marital  status  including  occupation  of  spouse  or  partner,  parental  status  and  family  responsibilities,  pregnancy  or  potential pregnancy, age, disability (including HIV or AIDS) or carer's responsibilities may be unlawful if it is hurtful  or  offensive  to  the  recipient  and  has  the  effect  of  disadvantaging  the  recipient  in  his  or  her  employment.

_What is not harassment?_

 - Requests  to  perform  legitimate  and  reasonable  work  requirements,  reasonable  management  practices,  organisational change or downsizing are not harassment.
 
_What is sexual harassment?_
 
 - Sexual harassment is an unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, which may possibly cause a reasonable person to feel offended, humiliated or intimidated. Sexual harassment is against the law. 
 - Legal action can be taken against individual employees for sexual harassment and expose Neontribe to liability.
 - This includes actions from any person within Neontribe, towards any other person within the organisation or any other organisation participating in Amnesty's work.
 - Sexually harassing behaviour may include but is not limited to: offensive or demeaning comments, jokes or innuendo;  offensive  gestures,  starring  or  displaying  offensive  material;  unwelcome  or  uncalled  for  remarks  or  insinuations  about  a  person's  sexual  activities  or  private  life;  demands  for  sexual  favours;  unwanted  sexual propositions or advances; or any unwanted physical contact.
 - It is unlawful if there is a request for sexual intercourse, sexual contact or other forms of sexual activity that contains an implied or overt promise of preferential or detrimental treatment of a person's employment, or an implied or overt threat about present or future employment status.
 
_What is not sexual harassment?_

- Mutual  attraction  or  friendship  between  two  people  who  welcome  the  attention  is  not  sexual  harassment.   Neontribe  is  concerned  only  with  behaviour  that  adversely  affects  the  workplace  or  our  people,  not  with  the  private lives of employees.

## Bullying

Neontribe  does  not  tolerate  any  behaviour,  which  creates  a  hostile  or  distressing  environment,  undermines  morale,  or  reflects adversely on the integrity of our organisation.

_What is bullying?_

 - Workplace  bullying  is  the  repeated,  less  favourable  treatment  of  a  person  by  another  or  others  in  the  workplace, which may be considered unreasonable and inappropriate workplace practice.
 - Behaviours  that  constitute  bullying  includes  behaviour  that  intimidates,  offends,  degrades  or  humiliates  an  employee or any other person within the organisation, possibly in front of co–workers or third parties.
 - Bullying  can  take  many  forms  and  may  include  loud  and  aggressive  tactics  such  as  yelling  or  screaming  abuse or subtle intimidation such as inappropriate comments about personal appearance, constant criticism, manipulation,  isolating  employees  from  normal  work  interaction,  'ganging–up',  practical  jokes  gone  wrong,  impossible deadlines or undermining work performance.
 
_What is not bullying?_

Workplace  bullying  is  not  single  incidents,  grievances  in  relation  to  legitimate  and  reasonable  work  requirements,  reasonable management practices, organisational change or downsizing.
