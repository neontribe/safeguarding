# Behaviour code for adults working with children

## TODO

 - person responsible for managing behaviour (line 11)
 
## Purpose

This behaviour code outlines the conduct Neontribe Ltd. expects from all our staff and volunteers. This includes agency staff, interns, students on work placement and anyone who is undertaking specific duties for the organisation, whether paid or unpaid.
The behaviour code aims to help us protect children and young people from abuse and reduce the possibility of unfounded allegations being made. It has been informed by the views of children and young people.
VOLUNTEER NEEDED must make sure that everyone taking part in our services has seen, understood and agreed to follow the code of behaviour, and that they understand the consequences of inappropriate behaviour. 

## The role of staff and volunteers

When working with or for children and young people, you are acting in a position of trust. You are likely to be seen as a role model and must act appropriately.
