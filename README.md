## Why do we have a Safeguarding Policy Statement?

Neontribe works with children and families as part of its activities. This includes running learning activities that introduce people to coding and other work we do; creating software that children and young people may use; hosting work experience placements and carrying out user research.

### The policy statement is designed:

 - to protect children and young people who connect with Neontribe either directly or because the adults that care for them are connecting with our activities or software
 - to to make sure parents, staff and volunteers and the public understand the principles that guide our approach to safeguarding and child protection.

Everyone involved in Neontribe must be committed to upholding the values in described in this policy statement. It applies to anyone working on behalf of Neontribe Ltd., including directors, paid staff, volunteers, sessional workers, agency staff and students.

This policy has been drawn up on the basis of legislation, policy and guidance that seeks to protect children in England. A summary of the key legislation and guidance is available from nspcc.org.uk/childprotection.

## We believe that:

 - children and young people should never experience abuse, neglect or harm of any kind
 - we have a responsibility to promote the welfare of all children and young people, to keep them safe and to run our qctivities and create our products in a way that protects them.

## We recognise that:

 - the welfare of the child is more important than anything else
 - all children, regardless of age, disability, gender reassignment, race, religion or belief, sex, or sexual orientation have a right to equal protection from all types of harm or abuse
 - some children are more vulnerable than others as a result of their experiences and needs
 - we must work in partnership with children, young people, their parents, carers and other agencies to promote children and young people's welfare. 

## We will work to keep children and young people safer by:

 - valuing, listening to and respecting them
 - appointing a Senior lead for safeguarding (who will be a company director) and a deputy lead for safeguarding (who will be a company director or member of staff)
 - designing proportionate and appropriate safeguarding procedures to suit the level of engagement with children and young people in our various activities and products 
 - having clear procedures for recognising, responding to and reporting disclosures, allegations or concerns about or raised by children and young people
 - delivering our safeguarding responsibilities alongside work focused on preventing bullying and harrassment and promoting equality and diversity, using codes of conduct and other tools
 - delivering our safeguarding responsibilties alongside wider work on health and safety ensuring a safe physical enviroment
 - understanding safer recruitment processes, and ensuring that for staff and volunteers who have teaching or supervisory responsibilities for children and young people the appropriate checks and training are in place
  - recording and storing information professionally and securely.
  - reviewing this policy statement and related policies and procedures annually to ensure they are fit for purpose
